# Netflix Userbase Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to offer insights into how user information influences Netflix's monthly revenue. I also examine various aspects of the data to identify trends and insights to make data-driven decisions.

### Data Source

The dataset used is the "Netflix Userbase.csv" file from Kaggle. The dataset does not reflect actual Netflix data.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring the user data to answer key questions, such as: 

- What countries are the users located in?
- What type of devices are used to watch Netflix?
- What are the price points of the subscription models?


### Data Analysis


#### Questions to Answer

1) Which plans are the most popular among different age groups?
2) Determine the most popular devices used for streaming
3) Which devices are the most popular among different age groups?
4) Which subscription tiers are the most profitable?
5) Which markets are generating the most revenue?
   

##### Hypothesis

1) Premium subscription plans are most popular for Mature adults, whereas the Basic plan is most popular for Young Adults.
2) Users who access Netflix primarily through Desktops (Smart TVs & Laptops) generate more revenue than users who access via Mobile (Smartphone or tablet) devices.
3) Smart TVs are most popular for Mature adults, whereas smartphones are most popular for Young adults.
4) Users with Premium subscriptions generate higher monthly revenue compared to those with Base or Standard.
5) The United States and Canada generate the most revenue.



#### Results / Findings

1) I predicted that mature adults would have a larger budget to purchase the premium plan. However, the premium plan is actually most popular among young adults, while the basic plan is more popular among mature adults.

This suggests that the price points for plans do not correlate with age. Therefore, we can tailor marketing strategies to highlight the features of the subscription plans that appeal to different age groups.

2) Laptops and tablets are the most popular devices for streaming. To capitalize on this, we can optimize the user experience for these two device types since they generate the most revenue. Additionally, we can develop features and promotions specifically for laptops and tablets to further expand our user base.

3) I predicted that mature adults would primarily access Netflix through Smart TVs, which is accurate. However, smartphones are most popular with mid adults rather than young adults. Despite this, I believe there is a correlation between device types and age.
  
By leveraging this demographic and subscription data, we can create targeted marketing campaigns, such as promoting family plans to households and mobile-specific offers to younger users.

4) The basic plan is the most profitable tier, followed by the standard and then the premium plan. We can enhance marketing efforts to promote the basic plan in order to increase its revenue.
   
5) The United States generates the most revenue, followed by the United Kingdom and then Canada. To increase the user base, we can intensify marketing efforts in these countries. Additionally, I categorized users based on their world regions and found that most users are located in Europe. This suggests that although North America has fewer users, it remains highly profitable.
