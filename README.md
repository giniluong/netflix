# Netflix Userbase Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to offer insights into how user information influences Netflix's monthly revenue. I also examine various aspects of the data to identify trends and insights to make data-driven decisions.

### Data Source

The dataset used is the "Netflix Userbase.csv" file from Kaggle. The dataset does not reflect actual Netflix data.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring the user data to answer key questions, such as: 

- What countries are the users located in?
- What type of devices are used to watch Netflix?
- What are the price points of the subscription models?


### Data Analysis


#### Questions to Answer

1) Which plans are the most popular among different age groups?
2) Determine the most popular devices used for streaming
3) Which devices are the most popular among different age groups?
4) Which subscription tiers are the most profitable?
5) Which markets are generating the most revenue?
   

##### Hypothesis

1) Premium subscription plans are most popular for Mature adults, whereas the Basic plan is most popular for Young Adults.
2) Users who access Netflix primarily through Desktops (Smart TVs & Laptops) generate more revenue than users who access via Mobile (Smartphone or tablet) devices.
3) Smart TVs are most popular for Mature adults, whereas smartphones are most popular for Young adults.
4) Users with Premium subscriptions generate higher monthly revenue compared to those with Base or Standard.
5) The United States and Canada generate the most revenue.



#### Results / Findings

1) Although the Premium subscription has the highest price point, users with Base subscriptions generate the most monthly revenue, followed by those with Standard subscriptions and lastly Premium subscriptions.

2) Netflix can be accessed through four different devices: Smart TVs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Smart TVs and laptops are grouped as desktops, while smartphones and tablets fall under mobile devices. Data analysis indicates no correlation between device types and monthly revenue, with laptops generating the highest revenue and Smart TVs generating the lowest.

3) Analyzing the average age of users for each subscription model reveals that the ages are quite similar, around 38 or 39 years. Interestingly, Premium users have the lowest average age, while Standard users have the highest average age.

4) When grouping users into age brackets, it becomes evident that mature adults aged 43-51 generate the highest monthly revenue, while young adults under 34 generate the lowest.

5) I categorized the users based on their world regions and found that most users are located in Europe, which generates the highest monthly revenue, followed by North America.
